# Book Search Engine

## Description

[Heroku Deployment](https://evening-fortress-93265.herokuapp.com/)

Using a premade book search engine, this assignment was to refactor it from a RESTful API to instead use GraphQL and Apollo Server.

For documentation and full accessibility to the original code, none of the original code has been removed.

All sections with old code will have commentary.

## Bugs

Due to an error on my own localhost, there is a chance that running the application on a controlled environment will return POST errors from the Apollo Server.

## Usage

`npm i`

`npm run develop`

The GraphQL server can be accessed through `localhost:3001/graphql`
