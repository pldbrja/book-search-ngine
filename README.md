# Book Search Engine

## Description

[Heroku Deployment](https://evening-fortress-93265.herokuapp.com/)

Using a premade book search engine, this assignment was to refactor it from a RESTful API to instead use GraphQL and Apollo Server.

For documentation and full accessibility to the original code, none of the original code has been removed.

All old code has been removed to make it easier to read, however the original comments have been left in tact if the component it was with was not deleted.

## Usage

`npm i`

`npm run develop`

The GraphQL server can be accessed through `localhost:3001/graphql`
