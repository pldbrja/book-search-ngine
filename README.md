# Book Search Engine

## Description

Using a premade book search engine, this assignment was to refactor it from a RESTful API to instead use GraphQL and Apollo Server.

For documentation and full accessibility to the original code, none of the original code has been removed.

All sections with old code will have comments in order to make the code look less unorganized and easier to browse.

## Usage

`npm i`

`npm run develop`

The GraphQL server can be accessed through `localhost:3001/graphql`
